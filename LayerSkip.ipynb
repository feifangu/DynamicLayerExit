India Mayhew, seven, suffered serious head injuries after the horse bolted at a riding facility in Matheran 20 miles east of Mumbai (file picture) She had been riding just metres ahead of her father Gavin, 43, and a member of staff when the tragedy unfolded. Her mother, brother and two sisters were also riding in the grounds. The police said the member of staff and the girl's father managed to control the horse and rushed India to a nearby primary health centre. Sub inspector R N Khebude, of Matheran police, said: 'In his statement, Gavin said he was just behind his daughter and saw the entire incident. He said the horse suddenly went out of control and dragged her up to some distance, because of which she suffered serious injuries and died.' He said the victim's parents had chosen not to press charges against the operator, saying it was an accident. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai (pictured) with his family on March 30, staying in a five-star hotel in the city. On the basis of the victim's parents statement, police have registered a case of accidental death. Doctors stated her cause of death as head injury and shock, it has been reported. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai with his family on March 30. They were said to be staying at a five-star hotel in the city and went to the region of Matheran on Monday.

            "[Prediction]:  A former U.S. Army enlistee who posted on Facebook about \"the adrenaline rush\" of dying in jihad was arrested Friday and charged with trying to detonate a car bomb at Fort Riley military base in Kansas, authorities said. A second man, who allegedly knew about the bomb plot but didn't call authorities, was charged with failing to report a felony. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said. The \"bomb\" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release. Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, \"Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord.\" Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Booker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy. On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as \"The Big Red One.\" Booker said \"that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,\"  the criminal complaint said. He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said.

James Anderson unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of Bravo earlier in the contest. He is one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by Devon Smith off Root before the close. Smith lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in West Indies side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island. If he is part of history again then it really will have been an extraordinary last day.\n",

            "[Prediction]:  Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's relieved Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the Boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state's recent history - but doesn't believe he should be executed. In an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday, Warren reacted to Wednesday's jury verdict which found the 21-year-old guilty on all 30 charges related to the Boston Marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line. 'Nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice,' Warren said. When asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial, liberal-minded Warren stuck by her anti-death penalty stance. 'My heart goes out to the families here but I don't support the death penalty. I think that he should spend his life in jail - no possibility of parole - he should die in prison. But that's just how I see it. It's up to the jury,' she said. Scroll down for video. Life in prison: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Thursday that she doesn't believe convicted Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. Warren pictured left on CBS This Morning on Thursday. Tsarnaev pictured right in Boston federal court on Wednesday as his guilty verdict was read. Warren went on to speak about current Democratic party issues, as well as comment and likely presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the woman once thought to be a front-runner for her party refused to compare her politics to the former secretary of state. Warren has repeatedly denied that she will run in the Democratic primaries. Now that Tsarnaev has been found guilty of committing the Boston Marathon bombings, the case will move on to the penalty stage of the trial which could begin as early as Monday. It is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously. Justice: Boston Marathon bombing survivor Karen Brassard, second from left, speaks alongside Carlos Arredondo, left, Laurie Scher, second from right, and Mike Ward, on Wednesday following the conviction of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. While the death penalty is not allowed in state cases, Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option. However, experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of Massachusetts residents, they could decide against the\n",

            "[Prediction]: The British High Commission in New Delhi has expressed \"deepest sympathies\" to the family of the British girl who died after being thrown from a horse while on holiday in India. India Mayhew, seven, suffered serious head injuries after the horse bolted at a riding facility in Matheran 20 miles east of Mumbai. She had been riding just metres ahead of her father Gavin, 43, and a member of staff when the tragedy unfolded. Her mother, brother and two sisters were also riding in the grounds. The police said the member of staff and the girl's father managed to control the horse and rushed India to a nearby primary health centre. Sub inspector R N Khebude, of Matheran police, said: 'In his statement, Gavin said he was just behind his daughter and saw the entire incident. He said the horse suddenly went out of control and dragged her up to some distance, because of which she suffered serious injuries and died.' He said the victim's parents had chosen not to press charges against the operator, saying it was an accident. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai with his family on March 30, staying in a five-star hotel in the city . On the basis of the victim's parents statement, police have registered a case of accidental death. Doctors stated her cause of death as head injury and shock, it has been reported. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai with his family on March 30. They were said to be staying at a five-star hotel in the city and went to the region of Matheran on Monday. A spokesperson for the British Deputy High Commission in Mumbai confirmed India's death, adding: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'\n",

India Mayhew, seven, suffered serious head injuries after the horse bolted at a riding facility in Matheran 20 miles east of Mumbai (file picture) She had been riding just metres ahead of her father Gavin, 43, and a member of staff when the tragedy unfolded. Her mother, brother and two sisters were also riding in the grounds. The police said the member of staff and the girl's father managed to control the horse and rushed India to a nearby primary health centre. Sub inspector R N Khebude, of Matheran police, said: 'In his statement, Gavin said he was just behind his daughter and saw the entire incident. He said the horse suddenly went out of control and dragged her up to some distance, because of which she suffered serious injuries and died.' He said the victim's parents had chosen not to press charges against the operator, saying it was an accident. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai with his family on March 30, staying in a five-star hotel in the city . On the basis of the victim's parents statement, police have registered a case of accidental death. Doctors stated her cause of death as head injury and shock, it has been reported. Police said India's father worked with a UK-based company and arrived in Mumbai with his family on March 30. They were said to be staying at a five-star hotel in the city and went to the region of Matheran on Monday.

A second man, who allegedly knew about the bomb plot but didn't call authorities, was charged with failing to report a felony. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said. The \"bomb\" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release. Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, \"Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord.\" Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Booker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy. On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as \"The Big Red One.\" Booker said \"that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,\"  the criminal complaint said. He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said.

In an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday, Warren reacted to Wednesday's jury verdict which found the 21-year-old guilty on all 30 charges related to the Boston Marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line. 'Nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice,' Warren said. When asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial, liberal-minded Warren stuck by her anti-death penalty stance. 'My heart goes out to the families here but I don't support the death penalty. I think that he should spend his life in jail - no possibility of parole - he should die in prison.

Warren has repeatedly denied that she will run in the Democratic primaries.

It is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously.

            "[Prediction]:  Emily Grimson, from Shropshire, is one of Britain's most successful models yet it's not her stunning face that's her fortune - it's her perfect hands. And the 25-year-old has only been modelling for a year but has already built a lucrative full-time career making up to £100 an hour - but it's unlikely you've seen her face. Emily, a former beauty writer, moisturises her hands up to ten times a day to keep them looking their best. She exfoliates them once a week and always wears a strengthener to keep her nails from snapping. Emily used to write the beauty pages for a magazine but everyone would mention how lovely her hands are. Emily, who is signed with BMA Models, was encouraged to give hand modelling a shot after a nail technician complimented her hands while giving her a manicure. Since signing up for the modelling agency last year she has posed with everything from designer bags to electrical appliances, and always goes to great lengths to protect her hands. Emily said: 'I do have a strict routine to keep my hands looking their best. 'I moisturise them about ten times a day and always use SPF to protect them, even when the sun isn't shining. 'I exfoliate them once a week and always wear a strengthener to keep my nails from snapping. 'Sometimes I ask other people to open bottles or packets for me when I have a big job coming up as I don't want to risk any scratches or breakages. 'Oh, and I won't let my boyfriend get a kitten, despite the fact that he loves them, as a manicurist on a job warned me they carry a major scratching risk.' Since signing with BMA Models last year, her hands have starred in ads from designer bags to appliances. Emily says the money can be really good. if you film a commercial, you may even be paid a buyout fee. She started hand modelling around about May last year and has been doing it full time since autumn.<|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|># ;;<|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|># ;;;Emily Grimson, from Shropshire, is one of Britain's most successful models yet it's not her stunning face that's her fortune - it's her perfect hands.

            "[Prediction]:  Northern Ireland's tourism board is hitting back at actor Kit Harington after the Game of Thrones heartthrob cracked a few jokes at the expense of its capital city. Harington, who plays the character Jon Snow, poked fun at Belfast and tourism bosses when he appeared on a late-night chat show to promote the HBO series’ return to TV screens. The 28-year-old Londoner joked to host Seth Myers that Belfast is 'wonderful for two or three days' and emphasized that he has spent five years filming in the city, drawing laughter from a studio audience. Scroll down for video. Game of Thrones star Kit Harington told host Seth Myers that Belfast is 'wonderful for two or three days'. Northern Ireland is a principal filming location for Game of Thrones, which has a studio in Belfast, and fans travel from all corners of the world to visit beauty spots where scenes are shot. Tourism bosses have leveraged the show’s popularity to draw visitors and they said it has helped Belfast to become one of the most popular city break destinations in the UK. In a brief exchange on Monday night’s show Myers, host of Late Night with Seth Myers, which airs on NBC in the US, pointed out that Game of Thrones films in ‘a lot of incredible locations’, including Croatia and Spain. He added: ‘Your part isn’t in the nice places. What would you say to the traveller going to Belfast, or the tourist going to Belfast?’ The Londoner plays the character Jon Snow on the HBO programme, which is set to return for a fifth series. Harington said: ‘It’s wonderful for two or three days.’ Myers said: ‘And you’ve been there for years?’ Harington replied: ‘Five years.’ Myers said: ‘And what about Belfast?’ Harington said: ‘I’m not sure, I’m not sure.’ Myers said: ‘What about the tourism board?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘And the tourism board are great?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘And what about the tourism board?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘What about the tourism board?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘And what about the tourism board?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘And what about the tourism board?’ Harington said: ‘They’re great.’ Myers said: ‘What about the\n",
