hour .\n","Stars in ads for Bosch, the Disney Channel and magazine features .\n","Former beauty writer moisturising her hands up to ten times a day .\n","[Prediction]:  Emily Grimson, from Shropshire, is one of Britain's most successful models yet it's not her stunning face that's her fortune - it's her perfect hands. And the 25-year-old has only been modelling for a year but has already built a lucrative full-time career making up to £100 an hour - but it's unlikely you've seen her face. Emily, a former beauty writer, moisturises her hands up to ten times a day to keep them looking their best. She exfoliates them once a week and always wears a strengthener to keep her nails from snapping. Emily used to write the beauty pages for a bridal magazine but everyone would mention how lovely her hands are. Emily, who is signed with BMA Models, was encouraged to give hand modelling a shot after a nail technician complimented her hands while giving her a manicure. Since signing up for the modelling agency last year she has posed with everything from designer bags to electrical appliances, and always goes to great lengths to protect her hands. Emily said: 'I do have a strict routine to keep my hands looking their best. 'I moisturise them about ten times a day and always use SPF to protect them, even when the sun isn't shining. 'I exfoliate them once a week and always wear a strengthener to keep my nails from snapping. 'Sometimes I ask other people to open bottles or packets for me when I have a big job coming up as I don't want to risk any scratches or breakages. 'Oh, and I won't let my boyfriend get a kitten, despite the fact that he loves them, as a manicurist on a job warned me they carry a major scratching risk.' Since signing with BMA Models last year, her hands have starred in ads from designer bags to appliances. Emily says the money can be really good. if you film a commercial, you may even be paid a buyout fee. She started hand modelling around about May last year and has been doing it full time since autumn.<|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>Amanda Holden reveals she was'scared to death' when she was told she

capital city. Harington, who plays the character Jon Snow, poked fun at Belfast and tourism bosses when he appeared on a late-night chat show to promote the HBO series' return to TV screens. The 28-year-old Londoner joked to host Seth Myers that Belfast is 'wonderful for two or three days' and emphasized that he has spent five years filming in the city, drawing laughter from a studio audience. Scroll down for video. Game of Thrones star Kit Harington told host Seth Myers that Belfast is 'wonderful for two or three days' Northern Ireland is a principal filming location for Game of Thrones, which has a studio in Belfast, and fans travel from all corners of the world to visit beauty spots where scenes are shot. Tourism bosses have leveraged the show’s popularity to draw visitors and they said it has helped Belfast to become one of the most popular city break destinations in the UK. In a brief exchange on Monday night’s show Myers, host of Late Night with Seth Myers, which airs on NBC in the US, pointed out that Game of Thrones films in ‘a lot of incredible locations’, including Croatia and Spain. He added: ‘Your part isn’t in the nice places. What would you say to the traveller going to Belfast, or the tourist going to Belfast?’ The Londoner plays the character Jon Snow on the HBO programme, which is set to return for a fifth series.

While the defense rarely cross-examined witnesses in the first portion of the trial, they will be more active in the next stage as they attempt to convince the jury against sentencing Tsarnaev to death. One thing Tsarnaev's favor is his lead defense attorney, Judy Clarke, specializes in death penalty cases and has spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury. Pictured above leaving court on Wednesday, after hearing the guilty verdict for Tsarnaev. 'I haven't yet heard all the mitigating factors you'd expect to hear. In traditional death penalty cases, it's physical abuse, sexual abuse, drug abuse, dropping out of school,' Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert at Texas A&M University School of Law, said. However, Tsarnaev has yet another advantage of being put on trial in Massachusetts since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984. While the death penalty is not allowed in state cases, Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option. However, experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of Massachusetts residents, they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state's general politics on the issue. The prosecution will also have to convince the jury while Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death, proving that the crime was carried out with certain aggravating factors that warrant execution. So far they've listed such factors as killing a child and planning the attack for the day of the Marathon to maximize the loss of life.<|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>Home > Article > Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's relieved Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the Boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state's recent history - but doesn't believe he should be executed.<|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>importance of the Boston Marathon bombing.

Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers. To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information. All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals. The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads.

Justice: Boston Marathon bombing survivor Karen Brassard, second from left, speaks alongside Carlos Arredondo, left, Laurie Scher, second from right, and Mike Ward, on Wednesday following the conviction of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. While the defense rarely cross-examined witnesses in the first portion of the trial, they will be more active in the next stage as they attempt to convince the jury against sentencing Tsarnaev to death. One thing Tsarnaev's favor is his lead defense attorney, Judy Clarke, specializes in death penalty cases and spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury. Pictured above leaving court on Wednesday, after hearing the guilty verdict for Tsarnaev. 'I haven't yet heard all the mitigating factors you'd expect to hear. In traditional death penalty cases, it's physical abuse, sexual abuse, drug abuse, dropping out of school,' Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert at Texas A&M University School of Law, said. However, Tsarnaev has yet another advantage of being put on trial in Massachusetts since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984. While the death penalty is not allowed in state cases, Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option. However, experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of Massachusetts residents, they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state's general politics on the issue. The prosecution will also have to convince the jury while Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death, proving that the crime was carried out with certain aggravating factors that warrant execution. So far they've listed such factors as killing a child and planning the attack for the day of the Marathon to maximize the loss of life.\n","Summary: The Boston Marathon bombing trial is now in the penalty stage of the trial, which could begin as early as Monday.

Her mother Stacey Ciach, from Geelong in Victoria, had always wondered about the slightly narrow shape of daughter Ava's head. But it wasn't until she took Ava to a new doctor for a check-up that it was discovered two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely - a rare condition known as Sagittal Synostosis - restricting the growth of her brain. Scroll down for video. Five-year-old Ava Ciach, from Geelong in Victoria, suffered from Sagittal Synostosis - meaning the two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely restricting the growth of her brain. Ava, now six, had to undergo complex surgery in which she had her skull removed, smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle. 'It was just a miracle that this particular doctor thought \"I've got a few concerns about her head circumference\",' Ms Ciach told Daily Mail Australia. 'She wasn't abnormal, you wouldn't look at her on street and think there's something wrong with her. 'But he was really thorough and said he was going to do a full once over.' A CT scan proved Ava had the condition – usually discovered when a child is between 10 months and two years old – meaning she had to undergo a raft of medical examinations. 'From the moment it was confirmed it was just test upon test upon test,' Ms Ciach said. 'The waiting was just the worst – is this result going to be good or bad? Most were not positive but that's just what we had to deal with.' Ava's skull post surgery after it was'smashed' and put back together again. In September last year Ava underwent the operation, which involved making an incision from ear to ear and removing her whole skull. Ava was then taken to a combined clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne with reconstructive plastic surgeon Jonathan Burge and 14 other neurosurgeons and other specialists to decide the course of action. They booked her in for surgery four days later. 'They just said \"She needs this surgery now\",' Ms Ciach said.

Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’ In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery.

Officials from the anti-racism body say they have acted on complaints from some Hartlepool fans and urged Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who might decide to 'black up' for the occasion. Jamaican reggae artist Marley was a multi-million-selling artist, famed for his music and as a Rastafarian for his dreadlocked look, who died of cancer aged 36 in 1981. Hartlepool United fans have a history of fancy dress, travelling as the Smurfs to Charlton in 2012. Hartlepool fans are planning to dress up as Bob Marley for the final game of this season at Carlisle. A statement from Kick It Out read: 'We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool United supporters about the Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club's fans for their fixture against Carlisle United at Brunton Park on Saturday 2 May. 'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture. 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.'

The flashpoint? A controversial Beijing-backed election proposal tabled Wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto, describing it as \"ridiculous.\" In a speech before the city's legislature, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam said that if approved, the proposal would give Hong Kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017. The catch, of course, is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-China committee. Dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as Lam's speech ended. Some legislators raised yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the Occupy movement. \"Their fake universal suffrage is an insult to everybody's intelligence; that's why we refused to stay in the chamber.\" Hong Kong Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau told CNN. Lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law. Hong Kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years as the city fights over what kind of political system it should have as a Special Administrative Region of China. According to the agreement signed by the United Kingdom that returned the city to Chinese control in 1997, Hong Kong would receive 50 years of \"high autonomy\" under an arrangement called \"One Country, Two Systems.\" Part of that deal included establishing an election system based on the principles of universal suffrage. But nearly eighteen years after the handover, the city continues to fight over what universal suffrage really means. Hong Kong's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long-awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote. All that's left is for the legislature to approve the proposal, and then everyone can go home happy, they say. Pro-democracy Hong Kongers beg to differ. \"If it is a genuine election, people should be free to stand and people should be free to vote,\" said Lau. \"Now all you have is a vote, and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites. It's horrendous. \"To say the majority of Hong Kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie.. If nothing is changed, we will definitely vote it down.\" To become law, the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of Hong Kong's 70 legislators\n"," 60% 6/10 [02:24<01:35, 23.91s/it][Example]:  Fritz the Golden Retriever from California has made quite a name for himself with his inability to catch .\n","His YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits .\n","Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time .\n","[Prediction]:  Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved.

Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich. They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals. JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona. They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid. Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid. ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich. Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep Guardiola has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year.
